## What are Graphs?

- A data structure that holds nodes aka vertices
- all other data structures fit into this category.  different rules may apply
- data and connections get "interesting"

## Terminology
- Direction: when edge points from one vertex to another `a -> b`
- Node / Vertex: an object or "container" that holds the "value" or values
- Edge: connection between vertices... how many does a node have?  can it have?
- Degree:  property of a node.  how many edges a node has
- A-cyclical:  does NOT loop via edges
- Cyclical: DOES loop via edges - aka can hit the same vertex more than once while traversing
- Neighbors: vertices connected by a single edge.  one edge away.  no more than one.  can have many neighbors
