## Code Review

reach out with any individual needs ASAP

## Whiteboard

## Imposter Syndrome

Micha Goebig: "Imposter Syndrome is NOT taking ownership of your accomplishments."

Blockers:  imposter syndrome is NOT the blocker.  the blocker is you just don't know the specific material YET.

## EC2 - Elastic Cloud Compute

Virtual Machine hosted in the cloud

## Elastic Beanstalk

opinionated service that allows us to deploy, and manage our application

## Serverless Architecture

serverless => a lot more severs AT AWS -> no more big monolithic servers that handle all the things.  instead we have a series of (micro) services potentially hosted in the cloud.  think cloud computing.  think AWS managing infrastructure


## Lambda

What specifically is a Lambda?  A function.  (with specific syntax)

What is this `=>`?  Fat Arrow, arrow in a javaScript arrow function.  ALSO: Lambda

## S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Bucket

Object Storage.  file, images, videos, text files, variables
Data Storage:

programmatically:
- upload
- read
- update
- maintain a repository of documents
- just store it in the "bucket(s)"
