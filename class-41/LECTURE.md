White Board Tips and Advice
- Timothee:  Make sure you understand the problem domain!  ASK QUESTIONS
- Xavier:  treat algorithm like a checklist.  break down into the smallest steps possible
- Branden G: check in with the interviewer.  get interviewer feedback, confirm on the right track
- Robert Ball:  NO SELF DEPRECATING HUMOR!!! 
- Robert Shepley: rather than focusing on a solution by solution system, know the data structure, and recognize some of the patterns (tortoise and hare). Be very intentional about your words.  professional acumen matters.  possibly solve the problem with a less optimal problem
- Use the visual for MORE than to just prove you understand the problem.
- Elaine: be honest.  if you know something is wrong in one area, potentially can work with interviewer to resolve issue
